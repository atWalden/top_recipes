        <h3><u>Directions</u></h3>
            <ol>
               <li>Line 2 baking trays with aluminum foil; set aside.</li> 
               <li>Stir together flour, salt, pepper, tarragon, ginger, mustard powder, thyme, garlic powder, and oregano in a shallow bowl until well-blended. Beat together egg and milk in a separate bowl until smooth.</li>
               <li>Dredge chicken breasts in flour mixture, shake off excess, then dip in egg, and again in flour. Place coated chicken breasts on one of the prepared baking trays; set aside to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
               <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
               <li>Dredge chicken breasts in flour once more; shake off excess.</li>
               <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place fried chicken breasts on the second prepared baking tray.</li>
               <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
               <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
